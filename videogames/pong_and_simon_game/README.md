Some notes about this project:

### Pong:

- Multiplayer game

### Simon Says:

- Can play up to 6 different buttons. Adding more buttons will cause for sound to not play on the 6th button onwards since there are only 6 audio files
- All buttons that take the user to their web browser are safe to click
- As a new feature, the game now has a level counter, and displays a different text once the player loses
- Also features a video in the background, with sound (please adjust the sound accordingly; it may be too loud and cause for you to not be able to listen to the game buttons which also play sound)!
